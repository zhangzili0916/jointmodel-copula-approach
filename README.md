# jointmodel-copula-approach
R code for "Joint modelling of longitudinal measurements and survival times via a copula approach"
This repository includes R code for the simulation study and real data analysis. All the studies were based on RStudio of version 1.3.1073
The file "simulationstudy.R" includes the R codes to perform the simulation study. Functions "Y.lmmsurGaucopulaNOPLOT" and "Y.lmmsurtcopulaNOPLOT" generate joint data of longitudinal measurements and survival times via the multivariate Gaussian and t copula. Functions "Y.lmmsurGaucopest.nlm" and "Y.lmmsurtcopest.nlm" perform the estimation process by assuming the joint data are generated under the multivariate Gaussian and t copula, respectively. The log-likelihhood functions "logliklmmsurGaucop" and "logliklmmsurtcop" are required in the estimation process.
