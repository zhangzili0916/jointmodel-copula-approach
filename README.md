# jointmodel-copula-approach
R code for "Joint modelling of longitudinal measurements and survival times via a copula approach"
This repository includes R code for the simulation study and real data analysis. All the studies were based on RStudio of version 1.3.1073
The file "simulationstudy.R" includes the R codes to perform the simulation study. Functions "Y.lmmsurGaucopulaNOPLOT" and "Y.lmmsurtcopulaNOPLOT" generate joint data of longitudinal measurements and survival times via the multivariate Gaussian and t copula
